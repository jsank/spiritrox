		<h1>SpiritRox</h1>
		<div class="mainA">SpiritRox aims to mimic the functionality that you
		may see on any particular ghost hunter or reality-based paranormal show.
		That is, the functionality of what is called a "Spirit Box." These devices
		are said to work because entities can "manipulate" electronic devices and
		select specific words from a dictionary in order to communicate with the living.
		Whether or not you believe this is up to you...but SpiritRox takes that to the
		next level by offering the same capabilities on your smartphone or tablet device. 
		The important thing to remember when using this device is that it operates under
		the notion that these paranormal entities can indeed manipulate electronic signals
		in order to communicate.
		<br><br>
		You will notice that each word that is "chosen" by the spirit also offers a time-stamp
		and either the mark of low, medium, or high. These are added values that the spirit can
		utilize in order to show the strength of this communication. Generally speaking, the "high"
		category means the signal was in a very strong range and "low" means the opposite.
		<br><br>
		This is the initial release, so take it with a grain of salt. Updates are coming! Enjoy!
